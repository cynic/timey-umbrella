# Development

## Once-off / setup

From the root of the umbrella project,

1. `npm install`
2. `mix deps.get`
3. `mix ecto.reset`
4. `mix amnesia.create -d Database --disk`

## Ongoing

Run `valkey-server`.

Run `mix phx.server`. Elm will be compiled to JS when it can be.

Adding a new data structure on the DB side? Use `mix phx.gen.json`; see [Phx.Mix.Gen](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.7.11/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.html). Examples:

- `mix phx.gen.json Data Task tasks text:string status:enum:active:complete:ignored`

# Testing

Within `assets/frontend`:

- `mocha tests/awesomebar.spec.js`
- `npx elm-test`
  From root:
- `mix test` (currently failing a bunch of the autogenerated ones)

## Testing libraries

Within `iex`, try

```
Mix.install [:poison]
import Poison
```

…then continue on.

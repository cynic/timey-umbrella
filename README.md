# Development

## Once-off / setup

1. `mix ecto.reset`
3. Register with a username/password.  I've got one in the `assets/frontend/awesomebar.spec.js` file, if I recall correctly…

## Ongoing

Run `mix phx.server`.  Elm will be compiled to JS when it can be.

Adding a new data structure on the DB side?  Use `mix phx.gen.json`; see [Phx.Mix.Gen](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.7.11/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.html).  Examples:

- `mix phx.gen.json Data Task tasks text:string status:enum:active:complete:ignored`

# Testing

Within `assets/frontend`:
- `mocha tests/awesomebar.spec.js`
- `npx elm-test`
From root:
- `mix test` (currently failing a bunch of the autogenerated ones)

# Database
